<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>The spectrum has been traditionally allocated statically over large regions (provinces) and for long times. The demand has increased, and there are portions underutilized (ex: areas with no population like deserts), so it is not efficient. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) techniques solve this.
![[Pasted image 20230301132033.png|400]]
Spectrum holes appear when primary users don't transmit.</p>
<h1>Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)</h1>
<p>These techniques involve 4 basic properties (explained later):</p>
<ol>
<li>Spectrum Sensing</li>
<li>Spectrum Decision</li>
<li>Spectrum Sharing</li>
<li>Spectrum Mobility
These basic properties can be enabled by the technology Cognitive Radio (CR).
Cognitive Radio (CR) is a technology that adapts the PHY layer based on the environment.
It is based on Software Defined Radio (SDR), which moves the PHY layer functions to software (hardware is simpler), allowing for more flexible devices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Spectrum management in a DSA scenario</h2>
<p>We define:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary network: legitimate (licensed) users of a certain spectrum band</li>
<li>Secondary network: users without a license to operate in a desired band (white space users) - Additional functionalities required (CR/DSA) - Capable of operating in licensed/unlicensed spectrum - Coordinated through base stations or ad-hoc operation - May include spectrum brokers (centtralize info about white spaces ; sharing; fees)
DSA/CR netowrks need:</li>
<li>avoid interferences with primary users</li>
<li>secondary users should still have QoS
Thus, the 4 basic properties require cross-layer design (not only PHY layer, but whole stack), which allows communication between non-adjacent layers, by having 2 elements in contact with all the layers.
=&gt; spectrum management affects all the layers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>1. Spectrum sensing</h3>
<p>Techniques to detect “white spaces”.
How? detection of weak signal from primary transmitters (3 options)</p>
<ul>
<li>Matched filter: recognize primary transmissions (requires a priori´knowledge of tx signals) -&gt; complex</li>
<li>Energy detection: using threshold -&gt; unreliable (energy can come from anywhere, like noise)</li>
<li>Feature detection (hybrid): coherent signal (not the exact signal, e.g. a tone. we'll assume it is not noise, it's intelligent, so we know that the primary user is using the spectrum) detection ignoring noise
Problems: hidden node problem =&gt; secondary user may not detect the primary transmitter and think it is a white space
Solution: amount of interference stays below a threshold (interference temperature), which is tolerated and does not degrade performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Spectrum decision</h3>
<p>Select best available channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimate available capacity of white spaces</li>
<li>Select most appropriate spectrum band supporting the desired QoS (maybe assigning non-contiguous channels: using more than 1 white space)</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Spectrum sharing</h3>
<p>Coordinate shared access to selected channel (among different secondary users)
We need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture: centralized or distributed)</li>
<li>Allocation scheme: cooperative (near optimal) or non-cooperative/selfish (not-likely-to-be-optimal)</li>
<li>Access: overlay sharing(use only white spaces) or underlay sharing (apply interference temperature to use primary user bands)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Spectrum mobility</h3>
<p>Vacate channel to avoid interference with legitimate channel owners</p>
<ul>
<li>if primary transmissions appear -&gt; secondary users may need to move</li>
<li>Spectrum handoff (after the handover, adapt to new channel): smooth and fast</li>
</ul>
<h1>Current status</h1>
<p>For TV transmissions white spaces, there is no need for [1. Spectrum sensing], only the use of a database</p>
